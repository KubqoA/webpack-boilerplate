## Webpack Boiler Plate

Prepared configuration for Webpack 2 for fast web development using the latest compiling tools.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to provide simple and reliable boilerplate for creating new projects using webpack. It is the skeleton for any webpack project, and it easily extensible. Nevertheless, it still remains highly usable in its original shape. In case you're wondering why did I create something like this and didn't stick with the many already prepared alternatives, the answer is simple. I wanted something that is simple, a configuration, a prepared project I can use over and over and that won't pull many unnecessary libraries to my project. I didn't manage to find anything like this, so I decided to create my own boilerplate. And here it is.
